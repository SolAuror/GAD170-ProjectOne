## Gameplay Systems

### Party Management
Recruit and manage a party of up to 4 adventurers. Each member has stats (HP, attack, defense), a level, and daily wages you must pay. New recruits are leveled up to match your party's average. Members who die are permanently tracked and can only return through resurrection — never normal recruitment.

### Gold & Economy
Gold is your core resource. You earn it by defeating enemies and through weekly survival bonuses. You spend it on wages, healing, blessings, recruitment, and resurrection. Party members may also steal gold while you sleep, with higher theft rates and amounts when wages go unpaid.

### Day / Night Cycle
Each day you can perform town actions and trigger one encounter. Sleeping advances the day, pays wages, rolls for theft, and resets all daily actions. Consecutive days without paying wages increase theft chance and inch towards mutiny.

### Combat
Encounters spawn a scaled group of enemies based on party size and days elapsed. Each party member attacks a random enemy, then surviving enemies counter-attack. The member who lands the killing blow earns all XP from that enemy. Defeating all enemies awards gold loot and a commission bonus.

### Healing & Blessings
The cleric can heal the party once per day for a small gold fee, restoring HP to each member. A full blessing costs significantly more but fully restores HP and removes the Cowardly debuff. Cowardly members receive 30% reduced healing from normal heals.

### Recruitment
Recruit a new party member for half your current total daily wages. Cowardly members inflate recruitment costs by 50%. When all named adventurers have died, a mysterious stranger with fully randomized stats can be recruited instead.

### Fleeing
Escape from battle at the cost of 10% of your current gold. All surviving (non-resurrected) party members are branded as Cowardly. No loot or commission is earned.

### Resurrection
Unlocked on day 7. Pay 100 gold plus the fallen member's daily wages to resurrect a random dead party member. Resurrected members return with a 10% stat penalty and are **Marked by Death** — they cannot become Cowardly but carry permanent stat reductions.

### Leveling
Members gain XP from kills. Every 2 levels grants +1 attack and +1 defense. Each level up also increases max HP by 10 and daily wages by 25%, so stronger parties cost more to maintain.


## Game Over Conditions

| Condition | Trigger |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Mutiny** | Wages unpaid for 3 consecutive days |
| **Total party wipe** | All party members killed in combat |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Script Architecture

Contains a 4 part partial manager class and random recruit generator attached to a Manager GameObject, a CharacterData script called PTSoul

### `PTManager` — partial class, 4 files

The central game controller. Owns all shared state (gold, party list, enemy list, day counter, UI references, balance constants) and is split into partial files for readability:

| File | Responsibility |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `PTManager.cs` | Variables, constants, `Awake`/`Start`, input setup, shared helpers (`ChangeGold`, `UpdateUI`, `TriggerGameOver`, `SetSunIntensity`) |
| `PTManager.Party.cs` | Party formation (`GetNextPartyMemberTransform`), `AddPartyMember`, `RemovePartyMember`, `LevelUpToPartyAverage`, `GetAveragePartyLevel` |
| `PTManager.Combat.cs` | `OnEncounter`, `OnAttack` (with kill-credit XP), `OnRunAway` |
| `PTManager.Town.cs` | `OnSleep`, `OnHeal`, `OnBless`, `OnRecruit`, `OnResurrect`, `OnReset`, `CanPerformTownAction` |

### `PTSoul`
Represents a single character — party member or enemy. Owns stats (HP, attack, defense, level, XP, wages) and status flags (`isCowardly`, `markedByDeath`, `isAdversary`). Handles its own damage, healing, blessing, XP, and level-up logic, and drives its own UI elements (name, health bar, XP bar). `PTManager` holds lists of `PTSoul` instances and calls into them to run gameplay.

### `PTSoulGen`
Centralized character generation system that creates both party members and enemies. Uses ScriptableObject data assets (PTSoulTypeData) to define races with configurable attribute ranges, level brackets, and rewards. Handles name generation with optional prefixes ("Mighty Salen the Dwarf"), stat randomization, and smart enemy scaling based on party level.

### `PTAdventureLog`
Singleton scrollable narrative log. Any script calls `PTAdventureLog.Log(message)` to append a rich-text entry. Handles auto-scrolling, entry count limits, and custom color tags for enemies (`<enemy>`), party names (`<partyname>`), etc.

### `DeadCharacterData`
Serializable snapshot class defined alongside `PTManager`. Captures a fallen `PTSoul`'s name, stats, and original prefab reference at the moment of death. Used exclusively by the resurrection system to restore the character with a configurable stat penalty.

### `PTSoulTypeData` (ScriptableObject)
Configuration asset for each race/creature type (Human, Elf, Goblin, etc.). Defines attribute ranges, spawn level brackets, name pools, gold/XP rewards, wage ranges, and per-level scaling bonuses. Supports both friendly (party member) and adversary (enemy) types.

### `PTSoulPrefix` (Data Class)
Defines stat-modifying prefixes like "Mighty" (+3 Might), "Feeble" (-2 Might), etc. Applied randomly during character generation with a 35% default chance. Each prefix targets one of the five attributes and applies a modifier clamped between -2 and +3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Gameplay Flows

**Daily Loop:**
```
Wake Up → See Wages → Find Enemies (E) → Fight → Win → Get Gold → 
Recruit (F) / Heal (Q) / Bless (1) → Sleep (Space) → Repeat
```

**Combat Turn Order:**
1. Compare average Sense: higher side goes first
2. Each phase: characters act in order of highest → lowest Sense
3. Party phase: player manually clicks Attack for each member
4. Enemy phase: all enemies attack automatically
5. New round starts, repeat until victory/defeat

**Stat Derivation Formulas:**
- **Max HP** = 60 + (Constitution × 10)
- **Attack** = Might × 4
- **Defense** = Constitution × 2
- **Crit Chance** = Luck × 3% (capped at 75%)
- **Crit Multiplier** = 1.5 + (Luck × 0.02) + (Might × 0.02) + (Sense × 0.02)
- **Damage Reduction** = Defense / (Defense + 50) — diminishing returns formula

**Enemy Spawn Scaling:**
- **Base Formula:** Random.Range(partyCount, partyCount × 2)
- **Daily Escalation:** After day 7, add +1 enemy per day
- **Example:** 2-member party on day 1 = 2-4 enemies; day 10 = 2-7 enemies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Balance Constants (PTManager.cs)

| Constant | Value | Description |

| `BASE_HEAL_AMOUNT` | 50 | HP restored per party member (base healing) |
| `HEAL_COST_PER_MEMBER` | 10 | Gold cost per member for healing service |
| `BLESS_COST_PER_MEMBER` | 100 | Gold cost per member for blessing service |
| `BASE_RESURRECTION_COST` | 100 | Base gold cost for resurrection (+ wages) |
| `THEFT_CHANCE_BROKE` | 0.25 | 25% theft chance when wages unpaid |
| `THEFT_CHANCE_NORMAL` | 0.1 | 10% theft chance when wages paid |
| `THEFT_PERCENT_BROKE` | 0.1 | 10% of gold stolen when broke |
| `THEFT_PERCENT_NORMAL` | 0.2 | 20% of gold stolen normally |
| `FLEE_COST_PERCENT` | 0.1 | 10% of gold dropped to attempt fleeing |
| `RESURRECTION_UNLOCK_DAY` | 7 | Day when resurrection becomes available |
| `WEEKLY_BONUS_INTERVAL` | 7 | Days between weekly survival bonuses |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design & Architecture Decisions

**Partial Classes:** PTManager is split across 4 files (Combat, Town, Party, Core) to organize code by responsibility domain while maintaining shared state.

**Data-Driven Character Generation:** PTSoulTypeData ScriptableObjects allow designers to configure new races/enemies without touching code. Each type defines attribute ranges, level brackets, rewards, and scaling.


**Turn-Based Initiative:** Each round, all combatants are sorted by Sense attribute. Average Sense determines phase order (party vs enemy), creating tactical value for high-Sense characters.

**Singleton Adventure Log:** Static PTAdventureLog.Log() allows any script to append messages without coupling, while automatic colorization maintains visual consistency.

**Resurrection Snapshot Pattern:** DeadCharacterData captures character state at death, allowing resurrection with stat penalties while preserving identity and preventing duplicate names.

**Status Flag System:** Boolean flags (isCowardly, markedByDeath, isAdversary) on PTSoul enable complex interactions without inheritance (e.g., cowards reduce healing, marked characters can't become cowards).

**Diminishing Returns Defense:** Formula defense/(defense+50) ensures high defense is valuable but never reaches immunity, maintaining tactical balance at all levels.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation Notes

- **Gold Safety:** All gold deductions use `Mathf.Max(gold - amount, 0)` to prevent negative values
- **Auto-Scroll Intelligence:** Log only auto-scrolls if user was already near bottom (within 10% threshold)
- **Formation Recentering:** When adding party members, entire formation recalculates to keep the group centered on spawn point
- **Prefix Rarity:** 35% chance to apply prefix ensures they feel special without being overwhelming
- **Enemy Level Capping:** Enemies never spawn above party's average level, preventing impossible encounters
- **Wage Inflation:** Each level-up increases wages by 25%, creating escalating economic pressure
- **Debug Mode Toggle:** Set `debugMode = true` in PTManager inspector to see AI decisions and spawn calculations in console
- **Escape Individual Rolls:** Each party member independently rolls escape based on their agility vs average enemy agility (50% base ± difference)
- **Colorization Regex:** Adventure log uses regex patterns to auto-detect and colorize gold amounts, HP, enemy names, etc.
- **Theft Escalation:** Being broke increases both theft chance (10%→25%) and theft penalty logic to create pressure
- **UI Context Awareness:** Control display dynamically hides unavailable actions (e.g., Heal button disappears after daily use)
- **Prefab Fallback Chain:** Resurrection tries original prefab → first party prefab → logs warning if all fail

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚖️ Recent Balance Changes

### v0.4 - Combat Scaling Adjustment
**Problem Identified:** With spawn formula `partyCount * 3`, a 2-member party faced 2-6 goblins on day 1. Action economy heavily favored enemies (6 attacks vs 2 per round), resulting in party struggling against full groups.

**Analysis:**
- Average Goblin: 70 HP, 6 attack, 2 defense
- Average Human: 90 HP, 8 attack, 9 defense (+3 party bonus)
- 2 humans vs 6 goblins: Each human takes ~3 hits/round = 15 damage
- Humans survive ~6 rounds but need ~27+ hits to eliminate all goblins
- Result: Enemies' numerical advantage overwhelming party

**Solution:** Reduced spawn multiplier from **3x to 2x** party count
- **Old:** `Random.Range(partyCount, partyCount * 3)` → 2-member party = 2-6 enemies
- **New:** `Random.Range(partyCount, partyCount * 2)` → 2-member party = 2-4 enemies
- Daily escalation remains: +1 enemy per day after day 7
- Enemy stat ranges unchanged; only quantity adjusted

**Result:** Improved survivability while maintaining challenge curve. Parties can win early encounters without perfect RNG, allowing progression to unlock healing, recruitment, and resurrection systems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📝 Development Notes

- **Character Generation Pipeline:** PTSoulGen → PTSoulTypeData → PTSoul → UI
- **Combat Flow:** OnEncounter → StartCombat → StartRound → Party Phase → Enemy Phase → Victory/Defeat
- **Resurrection Pipeline:** Death → DeadCharacterData → Resurrection → ApplyTo with penalties
- **Log Message Flow:** Any script → PTAdventureLog.Log() → ColorizeMessage → AddVisualEntry → Auto-scroll
- **Gold Transaction Path:** Any system → ChangeGold() → OnGoldChanged event → UpdateUI + Sound
